# Introduction

Hippo deploys and serves applications compiled to WASI. Developers write an
application and compile it to WASI. Applications are uploaded via Hippo's
management portal. In seconds, applications are served on the web.

Hippo provides an easy-to-use management portal for your application, allowing
users to deploy and roll back their application releases, edit configuration,
manage domain routing and TLS certificates, and view agrregated logs. Hippo
provides a simple permissions model to manage your users and groups.

Hippo provides a seamless edge routing model so you and your developers can
spend more time writing your application, and less time editing load balancer
configuration. Just add a domain to an application, attach a certificate, and
let Hippo do the work.

All of Hippo's functionality is exposed through a web application and (coming
soon) a command line interface.

If you'd like to learn how to deploy Hippo on your own server (or if you're
just getting started), follow the [quickstart guide](quickstart.md).

If you'd like to learn more about how your first app and deploy it to Hippo,
[follow through the tutorial](tutorial01.md) to deploy your first application.
